# Drunk Train Driver

A very simple game created for the purpose of learning the basics of [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js).

Get through your driver shift with the help of your friend alcohol. Don't overuse your own medicine, though, it makes you
sloppier and can even kill you!

Covered topics:

- Texture sprites (created using [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)) - loading them, moving them, animating them
- Game loop with multiple scenes
- Basic collisions
- Mouse events
